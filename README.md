# lossfunctions
This repository contains implementations of loss functions for binary classification on imbalanced datasets, including Binary Cross-Entropy, Weighted Cross-Entropy, Focal Loss, Class Balanced Loss, PGFL Loss, and AMRL. The code is designed for systematic comparison, reproducibility, and research on rare-event prediction problems.
